# LearnGit.io

Welcome to the publically facing repository for LearnGit.io. As you can see there is no code here! LearnGit.io is a paid service, and thus opensourcing the code on GitHub would be a bit counter-intuative; however, this repository is used to triage improvements and bugs using GitHub "Issues".
