Welcome to the publically facing repository for LearnGit.io. As you can see there is no code here! LearnGit.io is a paid service, and thus putting the code on GitHub would be a bit counter-intuative; however, this repository is used to triage improvements and bugs using GitHub "Issues".

* [Report a bug](https://github.com/JackLot/LearnGit.io/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+)
* [Feature request or content suggestion](https://github.com/JackLot/LearnGit.io/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature+request+%2F+content+suggestion&template=feature-request-or-content-suggestion.md&title=)
